# About

Hi there 👋 I am Deniz :)
A Biochemist (research scientist) in a past life, now I work as a Data Scientist.

🔭 I’m currently working on building agents and chatbots from opensource ollama models.
🌱 Meanwhile I am learning front end web development (to make nice UIs for my apps other than streamlit) and ML/DevOps to serve them to people who might or might not be interested.
👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will allow me to learn something new.
⚡ Fun fact: If I am angry enough, I can bench press 50 kg.
